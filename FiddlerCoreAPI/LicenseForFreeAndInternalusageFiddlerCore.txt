2.2	Internal Business Systems License with Updates and Support

2.2.1	Internal Business Systems License Grant. If You purchase an Internal Business Systems License with Updates and Support, Your Licensed Developers may use the Software in object code form only in the development of one Integrated Product. In addition, for the applicable period of one (1), two (2) or three (3) years from the date on which You purchased the Software, for which You have purchased updates and support (the "Subscription Period"), You will receive minor and major updates for the Software, as well as the "Priority" support package, each as described in further detail below. 

2.2.2	Internal Business Systems Scope of Use. Your number of Licensed Developers must correspond to the maximum number of seats You have purchased from Telerik hereunder. This means that, at any given time, the number of Licensed Developers cannot exceed the number of seats that You have purchased from Telerik and for which You have paid Telerik all applicable license fees pursuant to this Agreement. The Software is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk or other storage device). Your Licensed Developers may install the Software on multiple machines, so long as it is not being used simultaneously for development purposes at any given time by more Licensed Developers than You have seats.

2.2.3	Support. During the Subscription Period, You are entitled to the "Priority" support package as described in greater detail here: http://www.telerik.com/purchase/support-plans/, subject to the limitations and restrictions described in the following Fair Usage Policy.

2.2.3.1	Support Package Fair Usage Policy. Telerik may limit or terminate Your access to any or all of the support services available under the "Priority" support package if Your use of the support services is determined by Telerik, in its sole and reasonable discretion, to be excessive. 

2.2.3.2	In no event will Telerik provide support of any kind to end-users of Your Integrated Product.

2.2.4	Updates. During the Subscription Period, You will be eligible to receive all major and minor updates for the version of the Software that You license hereunder.

2.3	Redistribution.  

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee is granted a limited, non-transferable right to internally distribute the Program in object code form only as embedded in Your Integrated Product to Your Authorized End-Users for use solely within Your organization. You are not permitted to distribute the Programs pursuant to this Section: (i) in any format other than in object form, (ii) as a standalone product, or (iii) as a part of any product other than Your Integrated Product, or (iv) in any manner which causes the Programs to be stored on a server not owned or controlled by You. You must ensure that the Program is not distributed in any form that allows it to be reused by any application other than Your Integrated Product. Licensee is not allowed to and is expressly prohibited from granting its Authorized End Users any right to further sublicense the Program. For avoidance of doubt, Your Authorized End-Users are not permitted to use the Programs, or any portions thereof, for software development or application development purposes unless they also purchase a separate commercial license from Telerik for each of the users.

Upon termination of this Agreement, all Licenses granted to You hereunder shall terminate automatically and You shall immediately cease use and distribution of the Software; provided, however, that any sublicenses granted to Your Authorized End-Users in accordance with Article II, Section 4 shall survive such termination if such Authorized End-Users are in compliance with their license agreements with You. You must also destroy all copies of the Software not integrated into a live, functioning instance of Your Integrated Product already installed, implemented and deployed for Your Authorized End-User(s).  IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE REQUIRED TO PAY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY ANY TERMINATION DAMAGES OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING ON ACCOUNT OF THE TERMINATION.

8	WARRANTIES

Licensor warrants solely that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which Licensee licenses the Software. Licensor does not warrant the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all circumstances, nor that program errors will be corrected. This limited warranty shall not apply to any error or failure resulting from (i) machine error, (ii) Licensee's failure to follow operating instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than Licensor. In the event of a breach of warranty, Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and Licensor's sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all or any portion of the Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose, Licensee's sole remedy and Licensor's maximum liability shall be a refund of the paid purchase price for the defective Software only. This limited warranty is only valid if Licensor receives written notice of breach of warranty no later than thirty (30) days after the warranty period expires. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN ANY CASE, LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE FEES LICENSEE PAID TO LICENSOR FOR THE SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE. LICENSOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF CONTENT PROVIDED BY LICENSEE OR A THIRD PARTY THAT IS ACCESSED THROUGH THE PROGRAMS AND/OR ANY MATERIAL LINKED THROUGH SUCH CONTENT. ANY DATA INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAMS UPON SHIPMENT FROM LICENSOR IS FOR TESTING USE ONLY AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY ARISING THEREFROM.
